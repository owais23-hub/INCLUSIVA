Welcome to INCLUSIVA
Discover and host university events with ease. INCLUSIVA is designed to connect students, campus organizers, and administrators through a centralized platform, ensuring no opportunity is missed.

The Challenge: Fragmented Campus Communication
University campuses are vibrant hubs of activity, yet students often miss out on valuable opportunities like hackathons, webinars, and workshops due to fragmented communication channels. We aim to solve this by creating a centralized platform.

Missed Opportunities
Students frequently hear about events too late or not at all, hindering their engagement and growth.

Dispersed Information
Event details are scattered across emails, social media, and bulletin boards, making discovery a chore.

Limited Engagement
